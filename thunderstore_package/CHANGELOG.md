# Changelog

## 1.0.5
- Fix confirming a destination doing nothing. Selecting a warp from the map now actually
  warps you, instead of just closing the menu.

## 1.0.4
- Nudge the on-screen prompt up by 5 pixels.

## 1.0.3
- Nudge the on-screen prompt down and to the right so it sits beside the MAP header.

## 1.0.2
- Move the on-screen prompt to the top-left of the map page (left of the MAP header)
  and draw it in black.
- Render the prompt from a higher-resolution, bold source texture so it stays sharp at
  high internal resolutions instead of looking blurry.

## 1.0.1
- Fix a crash on load. The mod now hooks the resident pause-menu wrappers
  (KaleidoScopeCall_Update / KaleidoScopeCall_Draw) instead of the relocatable
  kaleido overlay, and no longer reads overlay data that isn't mapped at load time.

## 1.0.0
- Initial release: switch the pause-menu map page into a warp selector (C-Down) to pick a Song of
  Soaring destination from the map. Only unlocked owl statues are selectable. Configurable button
  and on-screen prompt.
